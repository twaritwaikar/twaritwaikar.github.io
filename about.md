Hello, I am Twarit Waikar.

Currently I am working at Salesforce as a software engineer and I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering degree from Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee in 2021. You can take a look at my [resume](https://chronicallyserious.github.io/assets/Twarit_Waikar_Resume.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

I quite like reading about operating systems, cloud, computer graphics, game development (including virtual reality), and also just high performance low level systems programming in general.

I was a part of IIT Roorkee's programming group known as [SDSLabs](sdslabs.co){:target="_blank"} where we built all our large-scale projects. I also helped with IIT Roorkee's technical magazine group called [Geek Gazette](https://geekgazette.iitr.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} by co-leading the design team.

During the past few years I have done internships in the field of cloud infrastructure management and simulations based on road traffic.

I worked on a driving simulator with Unreal Engine 4 (during my internship at Robert Bosch Engineering and Business solutions, Bangalore) which had realistic traffic rules integrated into it using third-party traffic simulators.

On my next internship I worked on reducing the cost of public cloud infrastructure being used at a team in Salesforce, partly in India and partly in USA. I was given the responsibility of coming up with a framework that can detect and report unused, unclassified, unlabeled cloud resources under their projects hosted on AWS and GCP.

Since then I have been shifting my focus onto more generalised systems design and development related fields by working on my side-projects. **To know more about my personal projects, take a look [here](/projects).**
